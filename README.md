# AVR Rust Blink - RUST in Morse Code

A Rust application for the AVR microcontroller that blinks the word "RUST" in Morse code.

The program uses the built-in LED on pin 13 (PORTB5) to display the Morse code pattern.

Designed for the ATmega328p on the Arduino Pro Mini and compatible boards.

## Prerequisites

* A recent version of the nightly Rust compiler. Anything including or greater than `rustc 1.63.0-nightly (fee3a459d 2022-06-05)` can be used.
* A recent version of Cargo. At least 1.52.0 or greater.
* The rust-src rustup component - `$ rustup component add rust-src`
* AVR-GCC on the system for linking
* AVR-Libc on the system for support libraries
* WinAVR for Windows users (provides avr-gcc, avrdude, etc.)
* FTDI or compatible USB-to-Serial adapter for flashing

## Building Manually

To build manually, run:

```bash
# Ensure time delays are consistent with a 16MHz microcontroller.
export AVR_CPU_FREQUENCY_HZ=16000000

# Compile the crate to an ELF executable.
cargo build -Z build-std=core --release
```

## Using Build Scripts

This project includes PowerShell scripts to simplify the build and flash process:

1. `build.ps1` - Handles the build process, with a fallback to manual linking
2. `flash.ps1` - Flashes the compiled program to an Arduino Pro Mini

To build and flash:

```powershell
# Set the COM port for your Arduino (or let the script prompt you)
$env:AVR_COM_PORT = "COM7"  # Change to your COM port

# Build and flash in one step
.\flash.ps1
```

## Morse Code Pattern

The program blinks "RUST" in Morse code on the built-in LED (Pin 13):

| Letter | Morse Code |
|--------|------------|
| R      | .-.        |
| U      | ..-        |
| S      | ...        |
| T      | -          |

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble flashing the Arduino, see the `FLASHING_TIPS.md` file for detailed troubleshooting instructions.
